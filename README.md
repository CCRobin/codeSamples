CODE SAMPLE 1
----------------
PROBLEM:
Given a data list of less than 100 integers and a number 'n'.
Where 'n' represents a max duplicate amount.
Find a solution (ex: removeDuplicates (int [] data, int n)) which returns the data list with all numbers that occur more than 'n' times in the data list removed.
Data list will contain atleast 1 number and n will be greater than or equal to 1.

Tests 1:
INPUT: removeDuplicates (new int[]{1,2,2,3,3,3,4,5,5}, 1)
OUTPUT: [1,4]

Test 2:
INPUT: removeDuplicates (new int[]{2,2,1,3,9,3,4,5,8}, 2)
OUTPUT: [2,2,1,3,9,3,4,5,8]

Test 3: 
INPUT: removeDuplicates (new int[]{2}, 4)
OUTPUT: [2]
